# 1. Syndrome associated with posterior inferior cerebellar artery thrombosis: 

a) Wallenberg syndrome
b) Medial medullary syndrome
c) Inferior alternating syndrome
d) Dejerine syndrome

## Correct Answer - A

Answer A. Wallenberg syndrome

- Wallenberg syndrome is also known as lateral medullary syndrome or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome.
- Wallenberg described the first case in 1895.
- This neurological disorder is associated with a variety of symptoms that occur as a result of damage to the lateral segment of the medulla posterior to the inferior olivary nucleus.
- It is the most typical posterior circulation ischemic stroke syndrome in clinical practice.


## Etiology:

- Wallenberg syndrome is caused most commonly by atherothrombotic occlusion of the vertebral artery, followed most frequently by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, and least often, the medullary arteries.
- Hypertension is the commonest risk factor followed by smoking and diabetes.
- Medial medullary syndrome, also known as inferior alternating syndrome, hypoglossal alternating hemiplegia, lower alternating hemiplegia, or Dejerine syndrome, is a type of alternating hemiplegia

characterized by a set of clinical features resulting from occlusion of the anterior spinal artery.

# 2. Space of Disse is in:

# 3. What are Gitter cells: 

a) Macroglia
b) Modified macrophages in CNS
c) Astrocytes
d) Oligodendrocytes

## Correct Answer - B

Answer B. Modified macrophages in CNS

## Gitter cells:

- These cells are macrophages and because of their appearance they are called "Gitter cells".
- They look this way because they are lipid-laden.


## Gitter cells

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

- These macrophages are thought to be mainly derived from circulating blood monocytes, but some probably originate from resident microglia.
- Any time there is parenchymal damage (e.g. inflammation, infarction, parasite migration) these cells will phagocytose lipid from degenerated myelin and cellular debris.
- These lipid-laden macrophages migrate to the perivascular spaces

![img-1.jpeg](images\img-1.jpeg)

and leave the CNS via the blood or CSF.

# 5. Which of the following exocrine glandular ducts are not obstructed in cystic fibrosis: 

a) Pancreas
b) Lung
c) Sweat gland
d) All of above

## Correct Answer - C

Answer C. Sweat gland
Most CF patients have 3 distinct abnormal characteristics:

- The ducts of the mucus-secreting glands are obstructed due to an increase in viscosity of these secretions leading to glandular dilatation and destruction.
- CF patients are prone to chronic bacterial colonization and infections.
- The sweat glands are not obstructed in CF patients because in serous glands such as sweat glands there are abnormal concentrations of inorganic ions, rather than glandular obstruction with thick mucus.
- The quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat test is a uniformly accepted method for diagnosing CF. The sweat gland ducts must be patent for this test.
- Obstruction of airways leads to bronchiectasis and atelectasis; pancreatic duct obstruction leads to pancreatitis and malabsorption; and plugging of bile ducts leads to obstructive jaundice.

# 12. What is the nerve supply of Submandibular gland: 

a) Auriculotemporal nerve
b) Lingual nerve
c) Glossopharyngeal nerve
d) Inferior alveolar nerve

## Correct Answer - B

Answer B. Lingual Nerve

- The submandibular glands receive autonomic innervation through parasympathetic and sympathetic fibres, which directly and indirectly regulate salivary secretions respectively.


## Parasympathetic

- Parasympathetic innervation originates from the superior salivatory nucleus through pre-synaptic fibres, which travel via the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (CN VII).
- The chorda tympani then unifies with the lingual branch of the mandibular nerve (CNVIII) before synapsing at the submandibular ganglion and suspending it by two nerve filaments.
- Post-ganglionic innervation consists of secretomotor fibres which directly induce the gland to produce secretions, and vasodilator fibres which accompany arteries to increase blood supply to the gland. Increased parasympathetic drive promotes saliva secretion.

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

# Sympathetic 

- Sympathetic innervation originates from the superior cervical ganglion, where post-synaptic vasoconstrictive fibres travel as a plexus on the internal and external carotid arteries, facial artery and finally the submental arteries to enter each gland. Increased sympathetic drive reduces glandular blood flow through vasoconstriction and decreases the volume of salivary secretions, resulting in a more mucus and enzyme-rich saliva.

# 18. Peripheral chemoreceptors respond to hypoxia using which channel? 

a) Calcium channel
b) Sodium channel
c) Potassium channel
d) Chloride channel

## Correct Answer - C

## Ans: C. Potassium channel.

- Carotid bodies are composed of glomus cells (also called type I), which are of neuronal phenotype and contain a variety of neurotransmitters.
- Glomus cells are in functional contact with the afferent nerve endings.
- Glomus cells are initial site(s) of sensory transduction.
- Hypoxia releases transmitter(s) from glomus cells, which in turn by depolarizing the sensory nerve ending leads to an increase in sensory discharge.
- One hypothesis assumes that a K+-channel protein is an O2 sensor and that hypoxia depolarizes glomus cells by inhibiting the $\mathrm{K}+$ channel, leading to an increase in cytosolic Ca2+, resulting in transmitter(s) release.

# 39. Menkes disease is associated with which enzyme deficiency. 

a) lysyl oxidase
b) Methionine synthase
c) Glutamyl aminopeptidase
d) Lysyl hydroxylase

## Correct Answer - A

## Answers: A. lysyl oxidase

One of the enzymes, lysyl oxidase, requires copper for proper function. This enzyme cross-links tropocollagen into strong collagen fibrils.
Menkes disease (MNK), also known as Menkes syndrome, is an Xlinked recessive disorder caused by mutations in genes coding for the copper-transport protein ATP7A, leading to copper deficiency. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes.
These are necessary for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels and the nervous system such as lysyl oxidase.

# 40. LCAT deficiency increases the following 

a) HDL
b) LDL
c) VLDL
d) Chylomicron

## Correct Answer - A

## Answer: A. HDL

Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency (LCAT deficiency) is a disorder of lipoprotein metabolism.
A deficiency of LCAT causes accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in certain body tissues. Cholesterol effluxes from cells as free cholesterol and is transported in HDL as esterified cholesterol. LCAT is the enzyme that esterifies the free cholesterol on HDL to cholesterol ester and allows the maturation of HDL.
LCAT is the enzyme that esterifies the free cholesterol on HDL to cholesterol ester and allows the maturation of HDL. LCAT deficiency does not allow for HDL maturation resulting in its rapid catabolism of circulating apoA-1 and apoA-2. The remaining form of HDL resembles nascent HDL.

# 41. A 25 year old alcoholic presented with edema,hypertension, ocular disturbance,and changes in mental state was observed, diagnosis of high output cardiac failure was made with Wet Beri Beri, this is due to deficiency of? 

a) Vit B3
b) Vit B6
c) Vit B9
d) Vit B1

## Correct Answer - D

## Answer: D. Vit B1

Wet beriberi is the term used for thiamine deficiency with cardiovascular involvement.
In the first stage, peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to a high cardiac output state. This leads to salt and water retention mediated through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the kidneys. A more rapid form of wet beriberi is termed acute fulminant cardiovascular beriberi, or Shoshin beriberi.
The predominant injury is to the heart, and rapid deterioration follows the inability of the heart muscle to satisfy the body's demands because of its own injury.
In this case, edema may not be present. Instead, cyanosis of the hands and feet, tachycardia, distended neck veins, restlessness, and anxiety occur.

# 42. Glutamine is Increase in CSF, blood and urine, this is due to deficiency of 

a) CPS-I
b) Arginase
c) OTC
d) Argininosuccinate synthetase

## Correct Answer - A

## Answer: A. CPS-I

CPS I deficiency is one of the proximal urea cycle defects and is due to a complete or partial deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I) which produces carbamyl phosphate from ammonia, ATP, and HCO3.
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1 or CPSI) transfers an ammonia molecule from glutamine or glutamate to a molecule of bicarbonate that has been phosphorylated by a molecule of ATP. The resulting carbamate is then phosphorylated with another molecule of ATP. The resulting molecule of carbamoyl phosphate leaves the enzyme.
CPS-I is the rate limiting (pacemaker) enzyme this pathway. CPS-I is active only in the presence of N-Acetyl Glutamate, an allosteric activator.

# 43. True about type 1 diabetes mellitus 

a) Decreased protein catabolism
b) Decreased hepatic Glucose output
c) Increased lipolysis
d) Increase glucose uptake

## Correct Answer - C

## Answer: C. Increased lipolysis

Uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type I diabetes) involves decreased glucose utilization, with hyperglycemia, and increased fatty acid oxidation.
Increased fatty acid oxidation leads to excessive production of acetoacetic and 3-hydroxybutyric acids and of acetone, which are known as ketone bodies.
2. Acetoacetic and 3-hydroxybutyric acids dissociate at body pH and release H leading to a metabolic acidosis.
LCAT is the enzyme that esterifies the free cholesterol on HDL to cholesterol ester and allows the maturation of HDL.
LCAT deficiency does not allow for HDL maturation resulting in its rapid catabolism of circulating apoA-1 and apoA-2. The remaining form of HDL resembles nascent HDL.

Immunoglobulins are synthesised in plasma cells which are believed to be end products of the differentiation of cells called Blymphocytes.
The liver plays a crucial role in the production of nearly all plasma proteins (albumin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, majority of coagulation cascade, and fibrinolytic pathways).
Notable exceptions include: globulins, factor III, IV, VIII.
Proteins produced by the liver: protein S, protein C, protein Z, plasminogen activator inhibitor, antithrombin III. Vitamin K dependent proteins synthesized by the liver include: Factors II, VII, IX, and X, protein S and C.

# 45. type of cholesterol present in gallstones? 

a) Amorphous cholesterol monohydrate.
b) Amorphous cholesterol dihydrate.
c) Crystalline Cholesterol dihydrate.
d) Crystalline cholesterol monohydrate.

## Correct Answer - D

## Answer: D. Crystalline cholesterol monohydrate.

Gallstones are hardened deposits of digestive fluid that can form in your gallbladder.
The most common type of gallstone, called a cholesterol gallstone, often appears yellow in color. These gallstones are composed mainly of undissolved cholesterol.
Precipitation of solid cholesterol crystals from supersaturated bile has an essential role in cholesterol gallstone formation.
Gallstones are composed principally of cholesterol monohydrate crystals (cholesterol stones) or the acid salt of calcium bilirubinate (pigment stones).
When bile is concentrated in the gallbladder, it can become supersaturated with these substances, which then precipitate from the solution as microscopic crystals. The crystals are trapped in gallbladder mucus, producing gallbladder sludge.

# 46. collagen present in skin is

- So far, 28 types of collagen have been identified and described.

The five most common types are:

- Type I: skin, tendon, vasculature, organs, bone (main component of the organic part of bone)
- Type II: cartilage (main collagenous component of cartilage)
- Type III: reticulate (main component of reticular fibers), commonly found alongside type I.

a) Ploy A polymerase
b) Ribonuclease
c) Transpeptidase
d) Peptidyl Transferase

## Correct Answer - A

## Answer: A. Ploy A polymerase

Polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(A) tail to a messenger RNA. The poly(A) tail consists of multiple adenosine monophosphates; in other words, it is a stretch of RNA that has only adenine bases. polyadenylation is part of the process that produces mature messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation. It, therefore, forms part of the larger process of gene expression.

# 48. Type-I hyperlipoproteinemia is characterized by 

a) Elevated LDL
b) Elevated HDL
c) Elevated chylomicrons
d) Elevated lipoprotein lipase

## Correct Answer - C

## Answer C. Elevated chylomicrons

Lipoprotein lipase deficiency (Type I hyperlipoproteinemia) results in increased level of chylomicrones.
Lipoprotein lipase deficiency is a genetic disorder in which a person has a defective gene for lipoprotein lipase, which leads to very high triglycerides, which in turn causes stomach pain and deposits of fat under the skin, and which can lead to problems with the pancreas and liver, which in turn can lead to diabetes.
The disorder only occurs if a child acquires the defective gene from both parents (it is autosomal recessive). It is managed by restricting fat in diet to less than $20 \mathrm{~g} /$ day.
The disease often presents in infancy with colicky pain, failure to thrive, and other symptoms and signs of the chylomicronemia syndrome.
The condition has also been called familial chylomicronemia syndrome, chylomicronemia, chylomicronemia syndrome. and hyperlipoproteinem type la.

# 49. In Kreb's cycle and Urea cycle the linking amino acid is

# 93. Antiretroviral therapy is to be given in HIV infected patients irrespective of presence of symptoms if CD4 count is less than? 

a) 100
b) 150
c) 200
d) 350

## Correct Answer - C

Ans. C. 200
Offer ART to symptomatic patients if the CD4 count is 200-350 cells/mm3
Consider ART for asymptomatic patients with CD4 count between 200-350 cells/mm3 and monitor closely for new symptoms.
If the CD4 count is 200-250 cells/mm3, physicians can consider repeating the CD4 test in 4 weeks in asymptomatic patients.
This is to rule out the possibility of a 20\% margin of error in laboratory results.
Patients should start ART before the CD4 count drops below 200 cells/mm3

a) Anemia
b) Neutropenia
c) Malaria
d) Filarial

Correct Answer - B

# Ans. is. B. Neutropenia 

Filgrastim is a recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) which is a 175 - aminoacid glyco-protein.
It differs from the natural granulocyte stimulating factor due to its lack in glycosylation and the presence of an extra N-terminal methionine. It has proved to be effective in the treatment of severe neutropenia.

# 133. All of the following are examples of Dietary fibre except- 

a) Pectin
b) Lignin
c) Cellulose
d) Gums

## Correct Answer - D

Ans. D. Gums

- Dietary fibre consists of unabsorbable cell wall and other constituents of vegetable food like cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, gums, pectins, glycoproteins and other polysaccharides.
- Dietary fibre absorbs water in the intestine, swells, increase bulk of stood by increasing water content of faeces and soften it, decreases transit time by facilitating colonic transit.
- "The presence of fibre shortens the transit times and increases the stool bulk"


## Dietary fibre is of two types:

Soluble fibres: It absorbs upto 15 times its weight in water as it moves through GIT, producing softer stools. Its good sources are oat, flaxseeds, peas, beans, apple, citrus fruits, carrots, barley and psyllium.
Insoluble fibre: It promotes movement of material through digestive system and increases stool bulk. It's good sources are wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts and vegetables.

b) Factor associated with exposure only and is distributed unequally in study and control groups.
c) Factor associated with both the exposure and the disease and is distributed equally in study and control groups
d) Factor associated with the disease and is distributed equally in study and control groups.

## Correct Answer - A

Ans. A. Factor associated with both the exposure and the disease and is distributed unequally in study and control groups.

- Epidemiological studies search for the causes of diseases, based on associations with various risk factors that are measured in the study. In addition to the exposures that the study is investigating, there may be other factors that are associated with the exposure and are also risk factors for the disease. If the prevalence of these other factors differs between groups being compared, they will distort the observed association between the disease and exposure under study. Such variables may partially or completely account for any apparent association between an exposure variable and disease. These distorting factors are called confounding factors or variables.
- Thus a Confounding factor is defined as one which is associated with both the exposure and the disease and is distributed unequally in study and control groups. It is itself a risk.factor.for the disease.

# 143. Risk of genetic diseases in consanguineous marriage between first cousins? 

a) $1-2 \%$
b) $4-8 \%$
c) $8-10 \%$
d) $12-14 \%$

## Correct Answer - B

Ans. B.4-8\%
Consanguinity is a marriage between relatives and has various degrees. Closely related individuals have a higher chance of carrying the same alleles than those less closely related and therefore children from consanguineous marriages are more frequently homozygous for various alleles than those from nonconsanguineous unions.
Generally speaking, frequency of congenital malformations among newborns of first cousin unions is about 2 times the frequency among the general population. In other words instead of a rate of 2$3 \%$ of birth defects in the general population, the risk to first cousin couples is around 4-6\%.

# 146. Vertical transmission of HIV is highest with- 

a) Elective caesarean section
b) High viral RNA load
c) Breast feeding
d) Term delivery

## Correct Answer - B

Ans. B. High viral RNA load

- Vaginal and emergency caesarean section deliveries, prematurity, and low CD4 cell count were most strongly associated with infant,s infection status in univariate analyses .
- Children delivered vaginally or by emergency caesarean section were more likely to be infected than those delivered by elective caesarean section, with a reduction in risk of $79 \%$ associated with the latter ( $\mathrm{P}<0.001$ ).
- Similarly, infants delivered before 37 weeks were more than twice as likely to be infected than infants who were not premature.
- Caesarean section before onset of labour and rupture of membranes approximately halves the risk of mother-to-child transmission.


## Transmission rate:

- During pregnancy: 5-10\%
- During labour and delivery:10-15\%
- During breastfeeding:5-20\%

# 150. What is against the rule correction in astigmatism: 

a) -1.25 cyl 90
b) -2 spherical 180
c) -3 cyl 180
d) +2 cyl 180

## Correct Answer - A:D

Types of regular astigmatism Depending upon the axis and the angle between the two principal meridia, regular astigmatism can be classified into the following types :

1. With-the-rule astigmatism. In this type the two principal meridia are placed at right angles to one another but the vertical meridian is more curved than the horizontal. Thus, correction of this astigmatism will require the concave cylinders at $180^{\circ} \pm 20^{\circ}$ or convex cylindrical lens at $90^{\circ} \pm 20^{\circ}$. This is called 'with-the-rule' astigmatism, because similar astigmatic condition exists normally (the vertical meridian is normally rendered 0.25 D more convex than the horizontal meridian by the pressure of eyelids).
2. Against-the-rule astigmatism refers to an astigmatic condition in which the horizontal meridian is more curved than the vertical meridian. Therefore, correction of this astigmatism will require the presciption of convex cylindrical lens at $180^{\circ} \pm 20^{\circ}$ or concave cylindrical lens at $90^{\circ} \pm 20^{\circ}$ axis.
***WE HAVE TO MUG THIS UP: A plus at 90 , or minus at 180 accounts for "with the rule astigmatism"**

# 152. A child has ptosis and poor levator function. What surgery will you do? 

a) Levator muscle resection
b) Mullerectomy
c) Fasanella Servat surgery
d) Frontalis suspension surgery

## Correct Answer - D

Answer D. Frontalis suspension surgery

- Muller muscle resections are typically used for repair of minimal ptosis ( 2 mm ) and are generally considered superior to the Fasanella-Servat procedure (tarsoconjunctival mullerectomy) in maintaining eyelid contour and preserving the tarsus.
- When levator function is poor, the surgeon should consider utilizing the accessory elevators of the eyelid in ptosis repair. This type of surgery is most commonly required in congenital ptosis with poor levator function or in various forms of neurogenic ptosis with poor levator function.
- Frontalis suspension surgeryperformed when levator function is poor or absent, the eyelid is suspended directly from the frontalis muscle so that movement of the brow is efficiently transmitted to the eyelid. Thus, the patient is able to elevate the eyelid by using the frontalis muscle to lift the brow. Frontalis suspension can be performed transcutaneously or transconjunctivally. This surgery connects the eyelid to the brow with a sling material and utilizes the power of the frontalis muscle to elevate the poorly functioning eyelid.

# 153. Which drug causes ocular hypotension with apnea in an infant? 

a) Latanoprost
b) Timolol

# 185. Cushing ulcer is seen in case of- 

a) Burns
b) Head injury
c) Cell necrosis
d) Stress

## Correct Answer - B

Answer- B (Head injury)
Cushing ulcers are associated with a brain tumor or head injury and typically are single, deep ulcers that are prone to perforation.
It is a gastric ulcer associated with elevated intracranial pressure. It is also called von Rokitansky-Cushing syndrome.
The mechanism of development of Cushing ulcers is thought to be due to direct stimulation of vagal nuclei as a result of increased intracranial pressure. Brain tumors, traumatic head injury, and other intracranial processes including infections, can cause increased intracranial pressure and lead to overstimulation of the vagus nerve.

# 188. Which vaccine to be given every year ? 

a) Hepatitis A
b) Hepatitis B
c) Influenza
d) Chicken pox

## Correct Answer - C

## Ans. C. Influenza

Influenza (Flu): The flu vaccine is recommended every year for children 6 months and older:

- Kids younger than 9 who get the flu vaccine for the first time (or who have only had one dose before July 2017) will get it in two separate doses at least a month apart.
- Those younger than 9 who have had at least two doses of flu vaccine previously (in the same or different seasons) will only need one dose.
- Kids older than 9 only need one dose.
- The vaccine is given by injection with a needle (the flu shot) or by nasal spray. The flu shot is preferred for children of all ages because it has been shown to be safe and effective. Although the nasal spray was not used in recent years, a changed version of it is now recommended (for the 2018-2019 flu season) for kids who may otherwise not get a flu shot. The nasal spray is only for healthy people ages 2 through 49. People with weakened immune systems or some health conditions (such as asthma) and pregnant women should not get the nasal spray vaccine.

# 191. Where to look for pre-ductal O2 saturation in PDA in a 3 minute born infant? 

a) Fetal left Upper limb
b) Fetal left lower limb
c) Fetal right Upper limb
d) Fetal right lower limb

## Correct Answer - C

## Ans. C. Fetal right Upper limb

A simpler way to detect this right-to-left shunting is to use two pulse oximeters and measure preductal and postductal SpO2. In one study it was found that arterial saturation in the right arm (preductal) of at least 3\%above the lower limb (postductal) is evidence of right-to-left ductal shunting.

# 192. True about Fragile X syndrome is- 

a) Triple nucleotide CAG Sequence mutation
b) $10 \%$ Female carriers mentally retarded
c) Males have IQ 20-40
d) Gain of function mutation

## Correct Answer - C

Ans. C. Males have IQ 20-40
Fragile X Syndrome

- Fragile $X$ syndrome is associated with a fragile site on chromosome X (Xq 29.3)
- Triple nucleotide CGG Sequence mutation
- About 20\% of women who are carriers for the fragile X premutation are affected by fragile X-related primary ovarian insufficiency.
- Individuals with FXS may present anywhere on a continuum from learning disabilities in the context of a normal intelligence quotient (IQ) to severe intellectual disability, with an average IQ of 40 in males who have complete silencing of the FMR1 gene.
- Fragile sites are regions of chromosomes that show a tendency to separation breakage or attenuation tinder particular growth conditions.


## Inheritance

- Inheritance does not follow the usual Mendelian single gene patterns
- It is due to Allelic expansion.

Clinical Manifestations :
The main clinical manifestations are :

1. Mental Retardation

- In fact it is the commonest cause of mental retardation in males.

2. Macroorchidism.

3. Characteristic facial appearance with :

- Long face

# 193. Foot drop is caused by injury to which nerve involvement: 

a) Femoral nerve
b) Tibial nerve
c) Common peroneal nerve
d) Sciatic nerve

## Correct Answer - C

## Answer C) Common Peroneal Nerve

Foot drop, sometimes called drop foot, is a general term for difficulty lifting the front part of the foot.

## Causes

Foot drop is caused by weakness or paralysis of the muscles involved in lifting the front part of the foot.

## Causes of foot drop might include:

Nerve injury. The most common cause of foot drop is compression of a nerve in your leg that controls the muscles involved in lifting the foot (peroneal nerve). This nerve can also be injured during hip or knee replacement surgery, which may cause foot drop.
A nerve root injury - "pinched nerve" - in the spine can also cause foot drop. People who have diabetes are more susceptible to nerve disorders, which are associated with foot drop.
Muscle or nerve disorders. Various forms of muscular dystrophy, an inherited disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, can contribute to foot drop. So can other disorders, such as polio or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
Brain and spinal cord disorders. Disorders that affect the spinal cord or brain - such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis or stroke - may cause foot drop.

# Which part of scaphoid fracture is most susceptible to avascular necrosis? 

a) Distal $1 / 3$ rd
b) Middle $1 / 3$ rd
c) Proximal $1 / 3$ rd
d) Scaphoid Tubercle

## Correct Answer - C

## Answer. C. Proximal 1/3rd

- Scaphoid fractures (i.e. fractures through the scaphoid bone) are common, in some instances can be difficult to diagnose, and can result in significant functional impairment.


## Epidemiology

- Scaphoid fractures account for 70-80\% of all carpal bone fractures.
- Although they occur essentially at any age, adolescents and young adults are most commonly affected.
- Older patients falling in a similar manner are more likely to sustain a distal radial fracture (usually a Colles fracture).


## Clinical Presentation

- Classically there can be pain in anatomical snuffbox which is thought to have a sensitivity of $\sim 90 \%$ and a specificity $\sim 40 \%$
- Fractures can occur essentially anywhere along the scaphoid, but distribution is not even:
waist of scaphoid: 70-80\%
proximal pole: $20 \%$
distal pole (or so-called scaphoid tubercle): 10\%

b) Subperiosteal abscess of ethmoid bone
c) Mucocele of frontal bone
d) Mucocele of ethmoid bone

## Correct Answer - A

## Answer. A. Subperiosteal abscess of frontal bone

- Pott's puffy tumor, first described by Sir Percivall Pott in 1760, is a rare clinical entity characterized by subperiosteal abscess associated with osteomyelitis.
- It is characterized by an osteomyelitis of the frontal bone, either direct or through haematogenous spread.
- This results in a swelling on the forehead, hence the name.
- The infection can also spread inwards, leading to an intracranial abscess.
- Pott's puffy tumor can be associated with cortical vein thrombosis, epidural abscess, subdural empyema, and brain abscess.

b) Tumor has distinct margin
c) Eccentric lesion
d) Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice

## Correct Answer - D

## Answer. D. Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice Given image is of Giant cell tumor

- Giant cell tumors of bone, also known as osteoclastomas, are relatively common bone tumors and are usually benign.
- They typically arise from the metaphysis of long bones, extend into the epiphysis adjacent to the joint surface, and have a narrow zone of transition.
Classic appearance

![img-18.jpeg](images\img-18.jpeg)

There are four characteristic radiographic features when a giant cell tumor is located in a long bone:

- occurs only with a closed growth plate
- abuts articular surface: 84-99\% come within 1 cm of the articular surface 1
- well-defined with non-sclerotic margin(though
- eccentric: if large this may be difficult to assess

Treatment

- Classically, treatment is with curettage and packing with bone chips or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).

# 198. What should be the most likely diagnosis of this 65 year old lady presents with backache and following radiograph of the spine shown in image? 

![img-19.jpeg](img-19.jpeg)
a) Osteoporosis
b) Spondylolisthesis
c) Spondylolysis
d) Discitis

## Correct Answer - B

## Answer. B. Spondylolisthesis

- Spondylolisthesis is subluxation of lumbar vertebrae, usually occurring during adolescence.
- It usually results from a congenital defect in the pars interarticularis (spondylolysis).

![img-19.jpeg](images\img-19.jpeg)

- Spondylolisthesis is usually fixed (ie, permanent and limited in degree). It usually involves the L3-L4, L4-L5, or L5-S1 vertebrae.
- Spondylolisthesis often occurs in adolescents or young adults who are athletes and who have had only minimal trauma; the cause is a lumbar vertebra weakened by a congenital defect in the pars interarticularis (spondylolysis).
- This defect can easily lead to fractures; separation of the fracture fragments causes the subluxation. Spondylolisthesis can also occur with minimal trauma in patients who are $>60$ and have osteoarthritis.
- If mild to moderate (subluxation of = 50\%), spondylolisthesis, particularly in the young, may cause little or no pain.
- Spondylolisthesis can predispose to later development of spinal stenosis.
- If due to major trauma, spondylolisthesis can cause spinal cord compression or other neurologic deficits; these deficits rarely occur.
![img-20.jpeg](img-20.jpeg)
[This x-ray shows stage 1 spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1. The black arrow shows the posterior border of L5, which subluxes anterior to S1. The red arrow points to the spondylolysis (congenital defect in the pars interarticularis).]

![img-20.jpeg](images\img-20.jpeg)

Spondylolisthesis is staged according to the percentage of vertebral body length that one vertebra subluxes over the adjacent vertebra:

- Stage I: 0 to $25 \%$
- Stage II: 25 to $50 \%$
- Stage III: 50 to $75 \%$
- Stage IV: 75 to $100 \%$

Spondylolisthesis is evident on plain lumbar x-rays. The lateral view is usually used for staging. Flexion and extension views may be done to check for instability.

# Treatment 

- Usually symptomatic.
- Physical therapy with lumbar stabilization exercises may be helpful.

a) Flexion, Abduction, Internal rotation
b) Flexion, Adduction, Internal rotation
c) Flexion, Abduction, External rotation
d) Flexion, Adduction, External rotation

# Correct Answer - B 

Dislocations are usually posterior, and occasionally anterior, or central through the acetabulum.

Posterior dislocation: Hip is flexed, adducted, and internally rotated, and leg is shortened.
Anterior dislocation: Hip is flexed, abducted, and externally rotated, and leg is shortened.
Central dislocation: Trochanter is displaced medially. One may be able to feel the head of femur rectally. There is no shortening.

# 200. True about Tenosynovitis of finger ? 

a) Fingers held in mild extension / Extension deformity at the involved fingers.
b) Tenosynovitis of little finger will spread to thumb rather than ring finger.
c) With involvement of little finger the infection can spread to the index finger.
d) Treatment is conservative.

## Correct Answer - B

Ans. B. Tenosynovitis of little finger will spread to thumb rather than ring finger

- Infection of the synovial sheath that surrounds the flexor tendon
- Infection from the flexor tendon sheath of the thumb can also extend along the radial bursa to the space of Parona and then into the ulnar bursa and the flexor tendon sheath of the little finger-and vice versa-leading to a "horseshoe" abscess.
Horseshoe abscess:
- May develop from spread pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, of many individuals have a connection between the sheaths of the thumb and little fingers at the level of the wrist

# 201. Most common joint involved in septic arthritis:

# 211. 60 year woman comes with 3rd degree uterine prolapse. What will be the management? 

a) Vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair
b) Pelvic floor repair
c) Sacrospinous fixation
d) Pessary

## Correct Answer - A

Ans. A. Vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair
Uterine prolapse surgery is performed to remove the uterus and repair the weak tissue. Uterine prolapse frequently occurs in postmenopausal women who've had one or more vaginal deliveries. Sagging of the pelvic muscles which leads to uterine prolapse can occur:

- If supportive tissues are damaged during pregnancy and delivery
- Due to estrogen loss
- As a result of straining repeatedly over the years (chronic cough, constipation etc.)
- Due to gravitational effects
- Depending on factors like age of the woman, desire for becoming pregnant and the overall state of a woman's health, the treatment plan is decided.
- Here the woman is of old age (non gestational) and have 3rd degree of prolapse. So best management of choice will be Vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair.

# 213. Chromosome number of partial hydatidiform mole is- 

a) $46 X X$
b) $45 X O$
c) $46 X X Y$
d) $69 X X X$

## Correct Answer - D

## Ans. D. 69XX

- A partial hydatidiform mole is a triploid pregnancy with 69 instead of 46 chromosomes and another strange complication of the reproductive process.
- Partial hydatidiform mole can be identified by ultrasound showing placenta tissue, some hygromatous cysts, some fetal oddities, but no clear fetus structure.
- Ultrasound is strictly an indicator. After spontaneous abortion or dilation and curettage, tissue needs to be examined by pathology and cytogenetics needs to be determined.
- If a triploid karyotype is determined as 69, XXX, 69XXY, or 69 XYY [6], then a partial mole can be confirmed.

# 214. Vulvar atrophy and itching are treated by- 

a) Estrogen ointment
b) Antihistamines
c) Tamoxifen
d) None

## Correct Answer - A

## Ans. A. Estrogens ointment

- Atrophic vaginitis, the medical term for this condition, occurs as a result of deterioration of the vaginal tissue.
- It's a common condition in postmenopausal women because as estrogen levels drop, the tissue that lines the vagina becomes thinner and more easily damaged.
- Women with atrophic vaginitis may also experience vaginal itching, burning, frequent urination, or vaginal discharge.
- Women can treat this condition topically with estrogen creams, tablets (Vagifem), or an estrogen-releasing ring placed in the vagina (Estring).
- Oral estrogen, available with a doctor's prescription, will also restore vaginal tissue.
- Vaginal lubricants offer an alternative for women wary of using estrogen.
- Moisturizers such as Replens, Astroglide, and Lubrin can reduce symptoms and make sexual intercourse more comfortable.

c) Orgasm phase
d) Refractory phase

## Correct Answer - C

## Ans. C. Orgasm phase

- The male sexual response is described as a sequence of phases including 4 stages: sexual desire, arousal, orgasm (ejaculation) and resolution.
The male sexual dysfunction usually occurs in one or more of the three first stages of the sexual response cycle, including:
- Dysfunctions of sexual desire (e.g. hypoactive sexual desire)
- Arousal (e.g. erectile dysfunction)
- Orgasm/ejaculation (e.g. premature ejaculation, retarded ejaculation or inability to ejaculate).
- Premature ejaculation occurs due to the rapid evolution of the two first stages of the sexual response cycle and is not necessarily related to strong sexual arousal or changes in erection.
- Premature Ejaculation seems to be a neurobiological problem that is related to low serotonin levels in those regions of the central nervous system that regulate ejaculation (brain and spinal cord).

# 217. First line of treatment of mastitis in a lactating mother is- 

a) Dicloxacillin
b) Cefazolin
c) Ceftriaxone
d) Ampicillin

## Correct Answer - A

## Ans. A. Dicloxacillin

- The beta lactamase-resistant penicillins have been recommended in the treatment of mastitis. These include cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, or flucloxacillin.
- Because penicillins are acidic, they are poorly concentrated in human milk, which is also acid.
- Therefore, cloxacillin and its congeners tend to treat cellulitis well, but they are less effective in eradicating adenitis, the most likely precursor of breast abscess.
- When patients are allergic to penicillins, cephalexin or clindamycin may be the alternative to erythromycin.
- Combination like co-amoxiclav should be avoided because of fear of inducing MRSA

b) Only NSAID'S
c) DMARD after initial 3 months of NSAID'S
d) Monotherapy with TNF drugs

## Correct Answer - A

Monotherapy with TNF drugs
Answer A. DMARD with Steroids
Given condition is Rheumatoid Arthritis

![img-41.jpeg](images\img-41.jpeg)

- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune multisystemic inflammatory disease which affects many organs but predominantly attacks the synovial tissues and joints.


# Clinical features: 

- It occurs between the age of 20 to 50 years.
- Women are affected about 3 times more commonly than men.

Following presentations are common:
a) An acute, symmetrical polyarthritis:

- Pain and stiffness in multiple joints (at least four)
- Symptoms of articular inflammation.
- The joints affected most commonly are the metacarpo- phalangeal joints, particularly that of the index finger.


## Other joints affected commonly are (given in Table):

Common

Less common

Uncommon

- MP joints of hand
- PIP joints of fingers
- Wrists, knees, elbows, ankles
- Hip joint
- Temporomandibular joint
- Atlantoaxial joint
- Facet joints of cervical spine


## On examination:

- Swollen boggy joints as a result of intra-articular effusion, synovial hypertrophy and oedema of the periarticular structures.
- The joints may be deformed.

Deformities in Rheumatoid arthritis
Hand

Elbow
Knee
Ankle
Foot
- Ulnar drift of the hand
- Boutonniere deformity
- Swan neck deformity
- Flexion deformity
- Early - flexion deformity

Late - triple* subluxation

- Equinus deformity
- Hallux valgus, Hammer toe, etc.

![img-42.jpeg](img-42.jpeg)
3.3 Rheumatoid arthritis - x-ray changes The progress of disease is well shown in this patient's x-rays. First there was only soft-tissue swelling and periarticular osteoporosis; later junta-articular erosions appeared (arrow); ultimately the joints became unstable and deformed.

# Treatment and prognosis

b) Can cause Astigmatism
c) Surgery is treatment of choice
d) UV exposure is risk factor

## Correct Answer - A

Answer. A. Arise from any part of conjunctiva

## Given condition is Pterygium

- Pterygium is a non- cancerous (non-neoplastic) growth of conjunctiva.
- Characterized by a wing-shaped fold of conjunctiva upon the cornea from either side within the interpalpebral fissure.
- Pterygium is always situated in the palpebral aperture.
- Pathologically Pterygium is a degenerative \& hyperplastic condition

![img-57.jpeg](images\img-57.jpeg)

of conjunctiva.

- The subconjunctival tissue undergoes elastotic degeneration \& proliferates as vascularised granulation tissue under the epithelium, which ultimately encroaches the cornea.
- The corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer \& stroma are destroyed.


# Etiology \& Clinical features 

- More common in people with excess outdoor exposure to sunlight (UV rays) dry, heat, high wind \& abundance of dust.
- Clinically, presents as a triangular fold of conjunctiva encroaching the cornea in the area of palpebral aperture, usually on the nasal side.
- Other findings are stocker's line (deposition of iron).
- Pterygium is an asymptomatic condition in the early stages, except for cosmetic intolerance.
- Visual disturbance or corneal astigmatism may occur.
- Visual disturbances are due to encroachment of pterygium on pupillary area or corneal astigmatism.
- Occasionally diplopia may occur due to limitation of ocular movements.


## Treatment

- Asymptomatic pterygium which is not progressive is best left alone.
- Surgical excision is the only satisfactory treatment.

# 268. Following test is used to diagnose which ocular condition as shown in image:

a) Strabismus
b) Heterophoria
c) Both A \& B
d) None of the above

## Correct Answer - C

## Ans: C. Both A \& B

Given image is cover-uncover test

- The cover-uncover test to diagnose various types of tropias, which is a medical term for strabismus.
- The single cover test is a test is used to determine if there is a heterotropia or tropia, which is manifest strabismus or misalignment that is always present.
- The first eye is covered for approximately 1-2 seconds. As this eye is covered, the uncovered eye is observed for any shift in fixation.

![img-58.jpeg](images\img-58.jpeg)

- The cross-cover test or alternating cover test is usually employed to detect heterophoria.
- One eye is covered, and then the cover is moved immediately over to the other eye. With heterophoria, when the cover is moved to the other eye, the eye that has just been uncovered can be seen to move from a deviated point.
- The difference between heterotropia and heterophoria can be easily understood as follows.
- With heterotropia, a correcting movement of the eye can be detected already by the simple cover test; with heterophoria, such correcting movement only takes place in the cross-cover test.
- People with heterophoria can create and maintain binocular fusion through vergence, and the cross-cover test purposely breaks this fusion, making the latent misalignment visible.

![img-62.jpeg](img-62.jpeg)
a) Maddox rod
b) Maddox wing
c) Maddox glass
d) Red glasses

## Correct Answer - A

## Answer A) Maddox rod

The Maddox rod test can be used to subjectively detect and measure a latent, manifest, horizontal or vertical strabismus for near and distance.
The test is based on the principle of diplopic projection
The Maddox rod is a handheld instrument composed of red parallel plano-convex cylinder lens, which refracts light rays so that a point source of light is seen as a line or streak of light.
Due to the optical properties, the streak of light is seen perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder.

![img-62.jpeg](images\img-62.jpeg)

![img-63.jpeg](img-63.jpeg)

## Correct Answer - A

Answer A. Projection fibres

## Internal capsule

- Area of white matter in the brain that separates the caudate nucleus and the thalamus from the putamen and the globus pallidus.
- The internal capsule contains both ascending and descending axons.
- It consists of axonal fibres that run between the cerebral cortex and

![img-79.jpeg](images\img-79.jpeg)

the pyramids of the medulla.

# Internal Capsule 

![img-80.jpeg](img-80.jpeg)

## Components

- The internal capsule is V-shaped when cut transversely (horizontally).
- When cut horizontally:
- the bend in the V is called the genu
- Anterior limb of the internal capsule.
- the posterior limb or crus posterius is the part behind the genu, between the thalamus and lenticular nucleus.
- the retrolenticular portion is caudal to the lenticular nucleus and carries optic tracts including the geniculocalcarine radiations.
- the sublenticular portion is beneath the lenticular nucleus and are tracts involved in the auditory pathway from medial geniculate nucleus to the primary auditory cortex (Brodmann Area 41).

# 287. Identify the structure marked by a red arrow in the given image: 

![img-82.jpeg](img-82.jpeg)
a) Great vein of galen
b) Pineal gland
c) Fornix
d) Falx cerebri

## Correct Answer - C

Answer C. Fornix

- The fornix is the main efferent system of the hippocampus and an important part of the limbic system.
- It is one of the commissural fibers connecting the cerebral hemispheres.


## Gross anatomy

- Roughly C-shaped, the fornix extends from the hippocampus to

![img-82.jpeg](images\img-82.jpeg)

the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus and the anterior nuclei of the thalamus.

- It is a curvilinear bundle of white matter fibers that begins as a group of myelinated fibers called the alveus.
- The alveus joins to form the fimbria of the hippocampus.
- The fimbria of each hippocampus thickens and then splits off from the hippocampus to form the crus (leg) of the fornix.

The fornix is composed of four parts:

- crura: best seen at the splenium of the corpus callosum at the level of the superior colliculus on coronal images
- commissure: connects the crura
- body: from the merging of the crura, provides one of two major paths through which the hippocampus communicate with each other columns (anterior pillars): curves anteriorly and dives into the hypothalamus (mammillary bodies)

# 288. What is the Nerve Supply of marked structure in the given image: 

![img-84.jpeg](img-84.jpeg)
a) Anterior interosseous nerve
b) Posterior interosseous nerve
c) Ulnar nerve
d) Median nerve

## Correct Answer - D

## Answer D. Median nerve

The structure indicated is the first lumbrical muscle of the hand.

* The lumbricals belong to the intrinsic group of muscles which act on the hand.
* The intrinsic muscles include the following muscles/groups:
- Thenar group (act on thumb)
- Hypothenar group (act on little finger)

![img-84.jpeg](images\img-84.jpeg)

- Adductor pollicis
- Lumbricals
- Interosseous muscles
- Palmaris brevis
* All the intrinsic muscles of the hand, except the thenar muscles and the lateral two lumbrical muscles, are innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve.
* The thenar muscles and the lateral two lumbrical muscles are innervated by the median nerve.
* A useful mnemonic for remembering this is MEATLOAF. "MEAT" refers to the Median nerve, and LOAF refers to the muscles which it innervates: Lateral two lumbricals, Opponens pollicis, Abductor pollicis brevis, Flexor pollicis brevis

# 289. Identify the marked structure in the image: 

![img-85.jpeg](img-85.jpeg)
a) Cerebrum
b) Brain stem
c) Corpus callosum
d) Cerebellum

## Correct Answer - D

Answer D. Cerebellum

![img-85.jpeg](images\img-85.jpeg)

![img-86.jpeg](img-86.jpeg)

- The cerebellum, which stands for "little brain", is a structure of the central nervous system. It has an important role in motor control, with cerebellar dysfunction often presenting with motor signs.
- The cerebellum is located at the back of the brain, immediately inferior to the occipital and temporallobes, and within the posterior cranial fossa.
- It is separated from these lobes by the tentorium cerebelli, a tough layer of dura mater.
- It lies at the same level of and posterior to the pons, from which it is separated by the fourth ventricle.
